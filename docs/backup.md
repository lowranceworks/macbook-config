# Backup 

## Caveats

### Contexts

I have not found a way to backup Contexts configuration

### Rectangle-pro

- You must export the configuration for Retangle-Pro before running the `backup.yaml` playbook. Another option is open rectangle-pro preferences, settings and select "Sync configuration to iCloud".
